The Dice Game is a web-based application that allows players to roll virtual dice to determine a winner. 
Implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game provides a simple yet engaging user experience. 
Each time the page is refreshed, two virtual dice are rolled, and the result is displayed immediately, indicating which player has won or if it is a draw.
